# My breast-stroke performance project with TypeScript

This is a demo TS project about my breast-stroke performance in 2024 (maybe some other years later). The original data all come from my video clips I recorded every time I went swimming. 

I mainly put down the total loops as well as the time cost. Perhaps in the near future I would develop a micro-app in WeChat or something to compute each metrics I need intelligently for a better data visualization. It would really be great to integrate D3.js module into my project and put into practice what I've learned from the latest _D3.js in Action, 3rd Edition_.

What an awesome idea!!!
